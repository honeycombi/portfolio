New classes!

- Representation theory. I thought this class was going to be death because it builds on abstract and linalg, both of which I'm not exactly good at, and it's a 4 pepper. This class turned out to not be bad at all, but the one down side of this class is that handouts don't exist so I have to live TeX notes and the homework is handwritten so it's sometimes hard to decipher.
- Nonstandard analysis. I know a lot of people enjoyed this class, but I found the class super boring so I'm dropping this.
- Arrow's impossibility theorem. This is taught by Ben, which means that it was very good. It wasn't too mathematical, but definitely my most interesting class of the day.
- Continuum hypothesis. Ugh this class is definition stacking so I keep losing track of definitions halfway through class and then getting confused.

At TAU I had my project meeting. Our group might end up splitting into two different projects, one more on dynkin diagrams, and the other on quiver reps. I think I'm going to go for the quiver reps because I'm finding semisimple lie algebra absurdly hard and it takes me forever to understand each definition.

Colloquium (Everyone Hates Analysis) was decent. The talk was pretty interesting, but it turned me from not having a strong opinion on analysis into hating it.

There weren't any super intriguing activities in the evening so I went to workout on the field by myself. I love being on the field during sunset because everything is lit up perfectly under the sunset and the sky is beautiful. I think I like the field more than Miller now.
