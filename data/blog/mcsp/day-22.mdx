This was definitely the worst trip so far. I also had to wake up kinda early (6:30), so I was kind of sleep deprived which made it worse. At least I got several hours of sleep on the bus rides.

The overall rafting part wasn't very interesting. Close to the start was the main atraction, which our guide hyped up way too much. He said it was a waterfall and was scary and people fall out of the boat and it's deep and told us that we had to do exactly what he said or else it wouldn't be great, and then everyone was waiting for the waterfall when he told us that we had already gone over it and "just hadn't noticed it." The rest of the rafting was very long with nothing to see, so we spent over an hour just sitting on an inflatable thing going a 1mph with nothing interesting going on.

Right as we got to where they were giving us lunch, it started pouring. It was a very cold day, with no sun, and I was wearing swimming shorts, soggy socks and shoes since they forced us to wear sneakers/hiking boots on the raft, and nothing else so basically everyone froze to death.

Fortunately the rain stopped, but the food they served us was multiple times worse than Dana, so ...

The rest of the day consisted of me spamming more of my project and failing to understand pretty much everything.
