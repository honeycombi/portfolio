I slept in pretty late (8:25) so I didn't have time to go to the gym.

Wow, this past week seemed to have zoomed by! While I do feel a bit sad that 1 week of classes is over, I'm trying to focus on the happier side - that there's still 4 weeks of classes left! Here are my final thoughts for each of my week 1 classes.

- Computability theory. My conclusion for this subject is that I do not find it interesting and thus will not look at it unless I have to.
- Complexity theory. A little more interesting and easier than computability theory, but still not my type of thing.
- Overly convoluted plans. Remains my favorite class! This class was the perfect difficulty for me, was very interesting, the lecture and homework complemented each other well, and I enjoyed it a lot.
- Jacobi sums. I believe that this has potential to be more interesting than overly convoluted plans, but I didn't understand parts of it so I'll definitely return back to this and make sure I understand everything.

Other interesting stuff

- AA meeting went OK, my classes for next week are likely The Residue Theorem, The Hales-Jewett Theorem, The Continuum Hypothesis, and Eigenstuff + The Probabilistic Method.
- Project blurbs are unfortunately not as interesting as I wanted them to be. Not sure which project I'll end up doing.
- LeKa went to Target a few days ago and bought a game called Throw Throw Burrito. We blew one of the inflatable burritos up and started walking around campus and throwing it at random people. It was very fun until we hit someone who got upset and something sharp deflated the burrito.
- Relays. Hardcore teamed with LeKa, JaMa, SaZh and got carried by all three. Halfway through the contest we got stuck on a problem (squirrels and bears travelling on a spaceship) but LeKa really wanted to solve it so we did not move to the next problem, and we proceeded to spend half of the contest failing to solve this problem. I still do not know how to solve the problem, but I guess it was worth it because the problem was very interesting. Since we spent half the test doing one problem, we did not place.
