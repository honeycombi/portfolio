As usual, let's start with classes:

- Computability theory. This class is very hard and I'm not very interested in the topic, so I haven't but putting a large amount of time into it and thus don't understand much.
- Complexity theory. We looked at some more stuff about PSPACE and NPSPACE. It was pretty interesting, but the homework is kind of hard.
- Overly Convoluted Plans. I love this class, and it's super interesting! One of the lemmas in the handout is very cool:

  For any $a \in \mathbb{R}$, for any $b\in \mathbb{C}$:

  $$
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-a(x+b)^2} dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}
  $$

  This class has convinced me that I should learn complex and functional analysis person, and I appreciate analysis much more than I used to. The homework is hard but very doable, and is the perfect difficulty for me.

- Jacobi Sums. This class is becoming more and more cool. Even though I don't understand a lot of it, I am convinced that this is super cool and will definitely spend some time after camp revisiting stuff from this.

Other stuff:

- I've been spending TAU solving Overly Convoluted Plans problems on a large whiteboard in a classroom Lovejoy which has been fun.
- Colloqium was very boring since it did not make much sense. It was on the Borsak-Ulam Theorem.
- After dinner I headed to the athletic center. I didn't feel like working out so I messed around in the basketball court for a while. I'm not very good at basketball so I totally didn't go 1/20 on free-throws while hitting front rim on 17/20 shots...

  The court is really nice and big, and I do have a picture but I don't have an easy way to post a ton of pictures here. If anyone has a good idea of a free place with a lot of storage, please let me know!

I'm going on (multiple?) trips off campus this weekend which should be fun.
