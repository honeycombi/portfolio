Classes:

- The residue theorem. Learned about the Residue theorem. This class is probably my third favorite class so far of camp, where overly convoluted plans and jacobi sums are the only classes I enjoyed more.
- Hales-Jewett theorem. I don't like this class as much anymore. Pretty much every proof is spam induction to watch not very interesting things happen. I still like power towers though.
- Continuum hypothesis. Still screw model theory.

Colloquium was Fruit Math Memes by Eric. I have seen this exact topic before, so it wasn't super interesting. The introduction was still funny though.

After dinner, LeKa decided that we should play throw throw burrito. Originally it was just us two, so when one person lost their burrito the other person basically ran across campus. Then JaMa joined for round 2, and eventually we decided to have boundaries so the other person couldn't run across campus. JaMa is too good at the card part of the game and I kept beating everyone in the throwing the burrito part, so I had the fear me token for the entire game but never won. At the end, we needed to head back so we played some weird variant and I won this. I am now 2-0 in this game and I'm going to claim that I will not lose a single round of this game for the rest of camp.
