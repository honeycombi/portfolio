Classes:

- The residue theorem. Got significantly harder, learned about Cauchy Residue Theorem.
- Hales-Jewett theorem. Decently interesting and significantly easier than I expected. Homework problems look very doable.
- Continuum hypothesis. Three classes in a row is tough on my brain, zoned out three quarters of the way into class and thus got lost.
- The category of sets. Dropping this class tomorrow since I don't like it and I think I can spend my time better working on my project.

Onto the interesting part: I got the project I wanted! I think the plan for now is to spend 1.5 weeks each on semisimple lie algebras and quiver representations, and then at the end have something to present. It looks very hard, but I'm very excited!

Unfortunately I'm having trouble getting large chunks of time to do hw so I haven't been doing as much as I should be doing. Dipped Assaf's colloquium to work on hw at the bottom of Miller with LeKa, which was very fun.

I don't think anything interesting happened for the rest of the day.
