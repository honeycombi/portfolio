Classes:

- The residue theorem. Got significantly harder, learned about Cauchy Residue Theorem.
- Hales-Jewett theorem. Decently interesting and significantly easier than I expected. Homework problems look very doable.
- Continuum hypothesis. Three classes in a row is tough on my brain, zoned out three quarters of the way into class and thus got lost.
- The category of sets. Dropping this class tomorrow since I don't like it and I think I can spend my time better working on my project.

Onto the interesting part: I got the project I wanted! I think the plan for now is to spend 1.5 weeks each on semisimple lie algebras and quiver representations, and then at the end have something to present. It looks very hard, but I'm very excited!

Unfortunately I'm having trouble getting large chunks of time to do hw so I haven't been doing as much as I should be doing. Dipped Assaf's colloquium to work on problems with LeKa, which was pretty fun.

My project requires a lot of linear algebra knowledge, and I have barely any, so I decided to spend a few hours speedrunning and see how far I can get. I watched the entire [3Blue1Brown Essence to Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B) at 3x speed. This took around 2 hours, and I still do not like linear algebra, but I guess I understand it a little better. There's still absolutely no way that I'll understand everything by our next project meaning because there's a lot of advanced linear algebra in there.

Bottom floor of Miller is definitely one of my favorite places on campus, and it's even more amazing because it's always open (unlike the library and gym which are always closed). It's really easy to be focused and be productive, which is a lot harder in other places on campus.

After linalg speedrun, I also decided to try to read stuff for the project. Holy this stuff is super hard. It looks super cool though, and I'm enjoy it! I think I'll need to spend a lot of time on this to keep up, but I'm enjoying it so it should be fun.

I checked out with LeKa to go back to Miller after signin and stayed there around 10:45, which was a good idea for getting a lot of work done but not really a good idea for my sleep schedule.
