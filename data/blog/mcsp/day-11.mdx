Classes:

- The residue theorem. This class is super awesome! Today we learned about Cauchy Integral Formula, which is cool!
- Hales-Jewett theorem. Still decently interesting, got introduced to Hales-Jewett theorem.
- Continuum hypothesis. Screw model theory.

It was raining super hard and I was in dorms for the last part of TAU, so I got soaked walking to Keyes for colloquium. The colloquium was by Misha and was on Map Colouring Tourism. I thought it wasn't the most interesting thing I've ever seen, but it wasnt terribly boring either.

Luckily after colloquium, it wasn't raining anymore so I decided to go to the gym. I decided to try to destroy legs on the weak machines. I can now max leg press (471 lbs) for 8 reps. I feel like I should move onto squatting on the bottom floor rather than using machines, but... iykyk.

I was fairly tired so I decided to go to bed, but I didn't want to sleep so I stared at the ceiling for a few hours with earbusd and music at full blast, until I finally drifted away into deep sleep.
