Classes:

- The residue theorem. This class is super awesome! Today we learned about Cauchy Integral Formula, which is cool!
- Hales-Jewett theorem. Still decently interesting, got introduced to Hales-Jewett theorem.
- Continuum hypothesis. Screw model theory.

Colloquium by Misha on Map Coloring Tourism was decent. It wasn't the most amazing thing I've ever seen, but it wasn't terrible either.

My project requires a lot of linear algebra knowledge, and I have barely any, so I decided to spend a few hours speedrunning and see how far I can get. I watched the entire [3Blue1Brown Essence to Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B) at 3x speed. This took around 2 hours, and I still do not like linear algebra, but I guess I understand it a little better. There's still absolutely no way that I'll understand everything by our next project meaning because there's a lot of advanced linear algebra in there.

Bottom floor of Miller is definitely one of my favorite places on campus, and it's even more amazing because it's always open (unlike the library and gym which are always closed). It's really easy to be focused and be productive, which is a lot harder in other places on campus.

After linalg speedrun, I also decided to try to read stuff for the project. Holy this stuff is super hard. It looks super cool though, and I'm enjoy it! I think I'll need to spend a lot of time on this to keep up, but I'm enjoying it so it should be fun.
