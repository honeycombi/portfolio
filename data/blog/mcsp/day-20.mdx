Classes:

- Representation theory. This is my only class that is continuing into the next week. Even though I don't exactly have that good of prerequisites for the class, I still think I have a reasonably well understanding of what's going on in class.
- Zero knowledge proofs. Still boring, probably because I have seen everything that was supposed to be mindblowing in the class already. I know a few other people really enjoyed this class though.
- Continuum hypothesis. I feel like the ending of continuum hypothesis got easier to understand, but I'd say that I'm happy this class is coming to an end because when I lost in the middle of class, the rest of class is basically me having no clue what's going on.

Overall, I'd say my classes this week were the least interesting set of classes so far, with each week decreasing in how interesting I thought they were. My final ranking of classes is Representation theory > Continuum hypothesis > Zero knowledge proofs. I guess my expectations after week 1 were too high after Overly Convoluted Plans and Jacobi Sums, but I hope week 4 classes are more interesting.

I went to relays again this week after missing last week, hardcore as usual. I forgot to bring a pencil and paper so I was basically headsolving for most of the contest. None of the questions were extremely interesting, which I was sort of disappointed by.
