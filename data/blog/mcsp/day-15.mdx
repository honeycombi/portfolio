Woke up early, happily found an empty row on the bus so I could get some sleep and listen to music. The trip was 2 hours, but it didn't feel long because I was asleep for most of it.

For the morning part, we were given three options. I decided to be lazy and just be on the beach. Since I brought a swimsuit, I decided that I should go into the water. The water was sort of cold, but definitely tolerable for a few minutes but not so much for 30 minutes. At some point I saw a dead floating jellyfish with a few other people and we tried to get it to go onto the shore, but we were unsuccessful and let it just float around. Unfortunately a lot of people got onto the beach, so I decided to eat lunch. Afterwards I felt super hot so I went back into the water for a bit and went sorta deep but then a big wave went over my head and I wasn't wearing goggles so I decided to stay in the shallow parts. Also I have a ton of mosquito bites and they sting in the water ugh.

For the afternoon part, I joined the hardcore hike up a mountain. It was fairly short - I don't remember the exact length but I think it was something between 4 and 5 miles. I hike at the weird pace where I'm ahead of the middle group but not as energetic as the front group, so on hikes I find it really hard to hike with other people. Halfway up two people were taking a break, and I decided to join them since they hiked at around the same pace as me. The entire uphill hike was very boring, mostly because it was super foggy and you couldn't see very far in front of you, let alone look at the view. On the way back, I fell behind a little bit because it seems like I'm a lot more cautious about foot placement so I don't kill my ankle and that I don't like jumping down too much so I don't kill my knees. I did spot and hear a frog in a pond which was cool.

After we got down I followed the front group to the beach where they did a human pyramid, which was cool.

We waited for the bus for a while and it started raining, and finally we got onto the bus after a while. I got another empty row to myself, but this time the bus ride was a lot less enjoyable. It was raining and super cold, and my long sleeved stuff was wet because a water bottle in my bag popped open so I was wearing shorts. I tried to sleep and tried to listen to music, but it was too cold for me to function normally.

Dana was closed by the time we got back so I wasted some time while the pizza they order for us wasn't here yet. I am a very bad child and forgot to sign in so I have work shift tomorrow.
