- Representation theory. This class is pretty cool! We learned about the intuition behind Maschke's Theorem.
- Arrow's impossibility theorem. Why why why why why filters/ultrafilters are disgusting pieces of garbage why are they appearing in all of my classes.
- Continuum hypothesis. This class is definition stacking so I keep losing track of definitions halfway through class and then getting confused. Also more filters ew.

Colloquium (Hyperspheres) is my favorite colloquium so far. The talk was really well presented, understandable, and showed some very counterintuitive cool stuff. I hope at some point I'll return and look at the stuff in this talk a little more deeply.

After classes I went to do a push workout, abs, and a tiny bit of running with LeKa. The last bit of running was in 90 degree weather and I was exhausted, and I ran a 100m in ~15 seconds. At some point on a cooler day and fresher legs I want to go see how much lower I can get.
