Since it's the first day of week 2 classes, I had assembly and three classes rather than the usual 4.

- The staff skits in assembly were very entertaining as usual.
- The residue theorem. This class was fairly easy and slow. I expect it to speed up significantly though, so I hope it's a smooth transition.
- Continuum hypothesis. Cool so far, but I'm not really a set theory person so definitely not the most interesting thing I've seen before. I followed the class pretty well.
- The category of sets. Originally I was going to show up to Eigenstuff, but switched last second. Unfortunately Category theory = abstract nonsense, so I'm thinking of dropping this class. It's not especially interesting, and the problems all have very boring solutions and I don't feel happy after I solved a problem.

After TAU, we had something I've been waiting for for a while - Project Selection Fair! The projects originally did not look as interesting as I anticipated, mostly because there was nothing on my current interests, but I am very excited for the project on Semisimple Lie Algebras/Quiver Representations/Dynkin Diagrams run by Kayla. I talked to a few staff running projects and this one looks the most promising.

One of my main goals was to do a project on something that I can't really do on my own, and bonus points if there's an output other than knowledge. This project fits this description quite well, so I really want this project. I did end up indicating interest for two other projects as backups in case if I don't get this project, but I really want this project and don't care as much about getting the others.

Hope projects live up to my expectations!
