Classes:

- Representation theory. I am pleasantly surprised that I still know what's going on in this class, because I thought I would get lost half a second into it.
- Zero Knowledge Proofs. I'm kind of disappointed in this class, because I already knew everything that was presented in class. This is my stuff and I thought it would go deep since it's a 3-pepper but the teacher literally spent half the class explaining what some of the relevant complexity classes were.
- Continuum hypothesis. This class is getting a little better, and I feel like I knew what was going on today more than yesterday!

Colloquium (Heisenberg Geometry) started off super confusing, but got progressively easier and more interesting somehow. I didn't understand some of the connections that were presented but the speaker did a good job convincing me that the topic is interesting enough that I should revisit it someday.

I went to go play basketball with others. It was quite fun, but I'm on the shorter end so I basically just stayed on the perimeter and shot jumpshots. Afterwards I went to do some more sprints on the field because I didn't feel like going back to the dorms.
