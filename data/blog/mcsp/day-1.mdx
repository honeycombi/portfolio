First official day of camp! In the morning I finally got around to meeting my RA and my RA group, as we had breakfast together. Right after we headed to the tent for the first assembly of the day, which was on academic logistical stuff. I didn't bring a jacket and was sitting near the edge of the tent, and there was no sunlight so I was kinda cold and thus not paying that much attention.

Towards the end of the assembly, we got a sheet to rank our AA choices. I went back to the dorm to fill this out, and then went to lunch with LeKa. Nothing that interesting happened at lunch, but I did see Po Shen Loh!

After lunch, I headed to Page Commons for the first math-related event of the camp: A colloqium by Ari on how a camper can/cannot escape bear(s) inside a circle and higher dimension disks. The talk was pretty interesting and I didn't get lost that much! After that talk I met my AA, but my meeting with him was in an hour so I had some free time.

I went back to my dorm, then went to check out the Harold Alfond Athletics Center. We saw most of it briefly: the three floor gym, the ice hockey rink (ice was removed from the surface and the rink was closed), the pool (closed), the basketball court (courtside was closed, stands were open), indoor track (open), and the cool outdoor space in the middle of the building.

I had to head back to have my meeting with my AA. After the meeting I'm still unsure of what I'll end up taking because there's way too many classes I want to take.

After my meeting I went back to the dorm to rest a little bit, then headed back to the tent for the second assembly of the day, this time on non-academic stuff. I found most of the beginning stuff quite boring and only paid attention to the skits at the end, which were really entertaining.

I had a few hours to kill off for the rest of the day, so I went with LeKa to explore other parts of the campus. We went to a few places and then to dinner, then walked around on the other side of campus. I wanted to see some of the sports fields but a lot of them were closed. I did race against LeKa in the 400m track and tried longjump for the first time, but I had eaten too much and hadn't warmed up properly so I got calf cramps and decided to lie on the ground for a while.

Afterwards we wandered around some more, briefly went to the July 4 celebration at the tent but nothing interesting was happening so I went back to the dorms and now I'm writing this. Really excited for tomorrow's classes, even though it'll be a hard choice on what classes to take!
