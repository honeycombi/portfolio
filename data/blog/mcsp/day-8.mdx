Very short post because nothing happened that deserves a long reflection.

I woke up not feeling too sore which was very surprising. I spent the morning on the second floor beanbags of Miller listening to music, staring at the sky through the roof window, and just thinking about life.

Eventually I had to go to lunch to catch the ice skating trip. The ice skating trip wasn't very interesting: I spent both bus rides listening to music, ice skated for two hours, taught some random people how do skate (did not succeed), and then zoomed around a bit on the very dull rental skates.

When I got back, I decided to go play basketball at the athletic center. There's a shorter hoop (9ft I assume?) that I could practice dunking and feel tall which was fun.

Other than ice skating and basketball I spent the other parts of the day talking to people and wandering around campus.
