- Representation theory. More Maschke's Theorem stuff.
- Arrow's impossibility theorem. This class got a little better because there weren't that many ultrafilters, but I still liked the first day the most.
- Continuum hypothesis. At this point I only get the general picture but don't understand much of the details. I don't have a ton of motivation to work on this class because I think my spare time is spent better working on my project, so I'll most likely just feel like this for the rest of the week.

Colloquium (High Dimensional Oranges) wasn't particularly interesting. I barely remember what the talk was about because I kept zoning out and I didn't think any of the results presented were super mindblowing/interesting.

My body was a bit dead from the past few days so I decided to mostly stay in my dorm and work on my project for the rest of the day.
