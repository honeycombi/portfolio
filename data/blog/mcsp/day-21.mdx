This trip was very short: It consisted of four hours of bus rides, one hour actually kayaking, and one hour eating lunch and messing around on the land.

- Nothing really happened on the bus, probably because I was asleep in the back for everything.
- I was in a kayak with LeKa. We were having a race and we were basically in the lead, but then mean people got really close to us and pushed us into the wrong direction and into a rock, so we ended up finishing second. Afterwards LeKa failed to sabotage people, and then he "conquered an island" of seaweed and rocks in the middle of the water and stayed there I got the kayak to myself for a bit. Overall, the kayaking part was really fun! I also learned that steering is really hard.
- The lunch and chill part was basically just me destroying people in spikeball. Went like 15 wins in a row or something like that, the best strategy of the game is to get a good pass so I can smash the ball super hard to make it go 50 feet in the air. The other team is blinded by the sun so it's an automatic win basically every time.

Afterwards when we got back, I spent a couple hours working on my project, which included watching a youtube video on Gabriel's Theorem and Morita Equivalence. I also tried to do some of the reading, but it was super hard and I basically got nowhere. My current impression of my project is that it's super cool, but it would be infinitely times more super cool if I could actually understand what was happening quicker. Something strange that's been repeatedly happening is that I work on my project, don't understand anything, and then go to sleep and then somehow my brain wraps itself around the content in my sleep.
