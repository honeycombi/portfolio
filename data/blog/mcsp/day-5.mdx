Before classes, I went to the gym. The gym here is very fancy, but unfortunately machines don't go as heavy as I want them to. Either I'm superhuman, or the machines here go pretty light. I was able to rep both max leg press (10 plates (450) + weight of machine (21) = 471lbs for 6 reps) and leg extensions (240lbs for 10 reps). I think I might need to move to squats rather than leg presses for leg day...

I'm thinking of making a physical challenge for myself for the entirety of camp. The gym hours are very strange here so it's hard to get a good and long workout in, so I've been using my shortish workout (~30 mins) that I normally do at home. Still, it's very possible for me to become stronger throughout the entirety of camp. Here are some ideas, feel free to contribute more and/or state your opinions on the current ideas.

- Gain (insert number lbs). I'm ~135lbs as of now, so a challenging but somehwat reasonable(?) goal would be to get to 150lbs by the end of camp.
- See how many machines I can max out. I've only tried two machines so far because the workouts I follow at home are only dumbell based because I don't have access to that many machines. I can't think of any machine off the top of my head that I think I can max out as of now, but I might be underestimating myself like I did with the leg press.
- Hit riduculous numbers on certain exercises. I don't know my max for any bench, deadlift, or squat, so I can't really set a good goal. Off the top of my head I want to try to get to $\sum=500$, but this might be insanely high or insanely low.

Back to the standard stuff: Classes

- Computability/Complexity Theory. No changes from previous posts.
- Overly Convoluted Plans. Remains my favorite class. We looked at some fourier stuff, which is very interesting.
- Jacobi Sums. I had no idea what was going on in class, so for the rest of the day, I spent a large chunk of time making sure I understood everything from previous days.

Other stuff

- I spent TAU failing to solve Overly Convoluted Plans P3. I did get P1 and P2 though which were very satisfying.
- Colloqium was very interesting! It was on Frieze Patterns which are very cool. The presenter also did a good job making the talk easy to follow and engaging.
- I went back to the gym to mess around after Colloqium. I maxed out the same machines because LeKa said he wanted to see me do that, and then I tried to beat my max chin ups record. I did pull a few days ago and was still slightly sore, so I failed to beat my max chin ups record (20) but still managed to get 16 which I guess I'm decently happy with. I was going to play basketball but there were people there and I didn't want to be in the middle of their workout.
