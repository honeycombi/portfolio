I woke up around 6:45, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I rushed a bit before getting on the bus but soon everything turned into a more relaxing vibe on the bus and I quickly forgot that I was at mcsp.

The ride was only a little bit over an hour, and I got a whole half row to myself which was nice to relax and listen to some music. When we finally got there, the trail didn't look very intriguing. It was very damp and there were a lot of tall trees, very similar to the trails near my home. I turned on my (very broken) Runkeeper app, and started heading up the trail.

Quickly the steepness increased, and the hike became more difficult. Since most of the people that I talk to were at the front of the trail, I decided to talk a bit with the people at the back of the trail. But once it got super steep, some people got really tired so there wasn't much conversation.

Without much conversation, the trail became boring and taxed on my motivation to keep going. But soonafter, we got above treeline and all of a sudden a beautiful view was revealed, making the uphill part of the hike totally worth it. I spent half an hour sitting on a rock enjoying the view, until the last group of people caught up and I decided to continue onto the short hike up to the very top. This part was very flat, and the top wasn't actually that interesting.

I ate my lunch atop the mountain, and then we were given three choices of where to go next: back down the same way we came from, to a nearby peak and back, or down a berry trail. I chose the second option, which also happened to be extremely steep and the most popular option. About a third of the way to the nearby peak I was in the middle of the pack and tried to catch up with the front pack, but the front pack was going super fast so I was literally going as fast as I could and still only barely caught up to them at the top of the other peak. This peak was even more windier and the view was basically the same, so it was not worth it.

Going back I tried to stick with this group, but my right quad decided to cramp so hard that I was unable to bend my leg so I sat on the ground and dropped rocks on my quad for around 20 minutes. Eventually the front of the middle pack caught up and I was feeling better so I continued along with them.

The hike back was not very enjoyable. At the start, the view was insanely nice so it was still fairly enjoyable. From the middle onwards, the hike became more boring and tiring because I was in between the front and middle so there was no one close to me and there were more mosquitoes. Towards the end, there was nothing particularly rewarding to see and I felt very tired. Every half an hour I felt like I was almost there and used that as my motivation to keep moving, but after several rounds of "almost there" the walk felt infinitely long. When I finally heard voices and I thought I was back at the parking lot, it turned out the voices I heard were the front group exploring a small cave system that was not the parking lot. I thought then that I was close to the parking lot, but I ended up walking at least another 45 minutes before I finally got the parking lot. The walk back felt triple the length of the walk up.

Here are my broken Runkeeper stats: 88.47 miles at a 6:30 min/mi pace and burned a total of 4,183 calories! Also managed to run mile 11 in 28 seconds!

Here are the real stats: first peak (13.something miles) + second peak (3.something miles) is apprximately 17 miles. Total hike was 9hr30min

I got an hour of sleep on the bus ride back which was very comfortable, until I randomly froze awake even though it wasn't cold outside.

I do have photos, but once again it's not super easy to post a ton of photos here so if you know of a free and easy to use place with a lot of storage let me know, or if you just want to see the images message me somewhere.
