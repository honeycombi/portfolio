Let's skip straight to classes:

- Computability theory. This class moves a bit fast: right now we're talking about Turing degrees. The annoying thing about the class is that the teacher leaves blanks in his definitions and fills them in way later, which messes with the chronological intuition in my brain. Also, this is the one class where the teacher doesn't hand out lecture notes, and every textbook uses different notation so I don't even have a reference other than my own live-texed notes. That means that one typo in my notes screws over my knowledge of the entire subject.
- Complexity theory. Today we talked about time/space hierarchy theorems which aren't very interesting in my opinion. I honestly don't think I like theoretical computer science as much as I thought I would. The lecture makes sense but the homework problems are really hard.
- Overly convoluted plans. My favorite class. Way more interesting than linear algebra, very happy I made the choice to change. Furthermore, this means that all 3 of my classes in the morning at in the same room so I don't have to move. In class we looked at sequence approximations to the identity and some other theorems, which was actually intuitive and cool!
- Jacobi sums. I don't understand the intuition between a lot of stuff, but I feel like the class would be a lot more interesting if I actually understood more of it. At some point I hope I can spend some time catching up because I'm pretty confident this would be my favorite class if I understood more.

Other stuff that happened:

- Colloqium on three-term arithmetic progressions, and the history of upper and lower bounds throughout the years. This colloqium was very easy to follow and was fairly interesting, but less interesting than the first colloqium.
- Went to the gym to do push around 6PM. There was a lot of people and machines were filled so I sticked mostly with weights. Also I was going to hit legs sometime, but I've had calf cramps almost every day so my calves are super tight and hurt when I walk. I tried the leg extension machine so I could figure out what weight I use since I don't use that machine regularly and had no clue what was a good weight for me, but I repped out max so I don't know what I'm going to do...
- Flailed around at TPS. I only was able to solve problems that other people on my team had already solved.
- Did laundry at night! Not very interesting for the reader but I'm proud of this accomplishment. Took around 90 minutes total (longer than I expected) to do which means that I went to sleep later than usual (midnight). Glad I did not destroy my clothing!
