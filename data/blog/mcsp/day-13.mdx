Last day of week 2 classes!

- The residue theorem. Complex analysis is broken. And I like it.
- Hales-Jewett theorem. Oops got kinda lost halfway through class and had no idea what was going on for the rest of class.
- Continuum hypothesis. Nothing has changed.

My brain was fried so I decided not to go to relays. However, my body was not fried, so I decided to do an explosive bodyweight leg workout that I made a while ago and it always makes me sore for like a week. The field is really calm and soothing, and the markings are good for 40 yd sprints. I love the field super much, and I managed to time my workout perfectly so that I could watch the sunset in between rests. I'm definitely going back to this track more now, especially on weekends when the gym hours are awful.

I stayed up until midnight, which is much later than I usually sleep. I listened to some music and watched people play three-player chess. Holy that game is so cursed and confusing.

I'm not going on to the field trip tomorrow, so hopefully I can feel rested and work on my project.
