Tldr: nothing happened

I decided to not go on the field trip since it didn't seem that interesting and so I could rest up, so that's basically what I did. I woke up late and barely got to breakfast on time and then worked on my project for the whole morning. I really like my project, even if I have no clue what's going on more than half of the time. I got stuck before realizing that lunch was about to close, so I rushed to Dana.

After lunch I felt super tired so I decided to take a nap. Unfortunately it was super bright and I could not figure out how to close the blinds and the window is super tough to close, so I basically did a push workout where I did dips on the window trying to get it to close and then a pull workout where I aggresively pulled on the wrong strings. This took 30 minutes for me to close the window and figure out how the blinds work.

I accidentally set my alarm for 3:30AM rather than 3:30PM, so it did not sound and I ended up taking a 3 hr nap before LeKa came back from the field trip and was confused why I was sleeping at 5:30 PM. He started asking me how my conversation with someone at school was going and my not-awake brain thought he was talking about someone at mcsp so I said a bunch of nonsense and confused the hell out of him until I realized that he was asking about someone else.

I felt really groggy for the rest of the day so I basically just chilled and talked to random people. I did not get as much math as I wanted to get done, but I'm still reasonably happy with the progress I made on my project.
