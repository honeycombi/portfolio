I travelled up to the local area today. The car ride was 7 hours, so it was on the longer side but it wasn't too bad. I'm staying at a nearby hotel for the night and then checking into camp tomorrow.

I arrived with a few hours to spare before sunset, so I decided to take a quick look around on campus. Here are my first impressions of the campus:

- The dorms have a cozy and warm feel! I was expecting a short, old, cabin-styled red brick dorm, so Woodman looked a lot larger and more modern that I expected. I think I'm staying in Foss, which is connected to Woodman, but I didn't figure out which part of the building it was.
- The grass in front of Miller Library illuminates the sunset perfectly. The building itself reminds me of Tuft's campus because it's really artistic and detailed. While it's nowhere near as big as the Hayden Library@MIT or Science Library@Brown, it's definitely more aesthetic and peaceful.
- The athletic facilities are probably the best among all of the colleges I've seen - Harold Alfond somehow looks even better than the spam email advertisements write it out to be. I'm definitely going to spend some time asserting dominance on every court they have. Hit me up if you wanna get destroyed in every sport they have.

There's still a ton of logistics that I need to figure out, but excited to meet everyone tomorrow!
