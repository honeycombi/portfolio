I forgot the names of a lot of people, but I’ll refer to campers by name using the standard $f(Firstname Lastname)=FiLa$ and staff by their first name, or their description if I don't remember their name. Side note: the screen of the computer I’m writing this on is completely broken so I can’t see half the stuff I wrote so this will probably contain errors and stuff will be in the wrong spot.

I ate breakfast at the hotel I stayed at and showed up to campus a bit early - I believe I was the first camper there. I tested negative (yay) and went into my dorm room to unload. Overall, the dorms are better than I expected, but unfortunately there’s no AC and the tiny fan isn’t doing much to cool it down.

Since camp didn’t provide lunch for today, I left campus to go to a random local Maine restaurant with my family. While I ordered penne with chicken and vegetables, I instead got spaghetti alfredo instead that tasted undercooked and over-seasoned...

When I returned to campus, there were still very few campers, and the only ones I found were taking on the challenge of folding 1000 paper cranes. I had no idea how to fold a paper crane, but WiFe was nice enough to teach me. It took me like 15 minutes to fold a really pathetic looking one with his help, so eventually I just decided to watch other people fold them instead.

Then, Arya said he was leading a campus tour, so I joined 4 other campers in the small tour. We didn’t really see anything interesting, he just pointed at random buildings and we went into where assemblies are held.

When we came back, I found the ping pong table and talked a bit with colorful shirt tall dude from Kansas that I can’t remember the name of (sorry). Eventually more people came over and we decided to play king of the castle.

One of the staff members told everyone that there was a game going on outside, so I decided to join along with everyone that I was playing ping pong with. The game was referee racing - the rules are 1) bracket style tournament, 2) two people race on a road down and back, 3) loser of each race calls out a handicap that the next racers all have to follow. Unfortunately I got destroyed by the same dude twice, both times because I’m bad at following the instructions: the first time I forgot about one of the handicaps until I was halfway through the race so I lost in the first round, the second time I was leading by a lot but we were supposed to run around a tree and I ran around the wrong one in the finals. oops.

I came back to relax in my dorm room for a little bit, then decided to go eat dinner. There’s a surprising variety of food and the cafeteria is quite big. Due to covid protocols, I decided to eat outside with most of the other campers. I talked to a few people but unfortunately forgot their names. All I remember is that there’s a ton of people from one school in Washington and there’s a ton of MOPpers.

I wandered around campus for a little bit afterwards and found a group of people that were playing mafia. I basically followed them around for a while and did nothing, but eventually they decided to play some weird card game and I decided to join. I teamed with JaMa, but I never figured out what the name of the game was, what the object of the game was, or what was happening at all so eventually I got bored and decided to wander around.

Eventually I returned back to the ping pong room. I played normal ping pong with two other people for a while, but then one of the staff members decided that it would be a good idea to play ping pong while four people ran in a circle around the table. Eventually more people came and there wasn’t enough paddles, so a lot of people started using their phones as rackets. I didn’t want to use my phone so I decided to use other objects in my backpack instead. Out of all of the objects I used, I say sunscreen bottle>pencil sharpener>water bottle.

There was like 20 people running circles around the table using random objects as paddles so it was a bit crowded, and it was getting late, so I decided to leave and shower. I requested a single, but it got denied, so I’m rooming with LeKa on the quiet after 10pm floor. LeKa flew over from California so he got here a bit later than most people, so he had basically just arrived as I went back into my dorm room. Fortunately the showers were empty, but the design is kind of stupid - the walls are slanted so the curtains don’t cover everything.

Now I’m back in my dorm room writing this post on my broken computer, and I’ll probably go sleep soon because I have to be up around 7:30 tomorrow.

OK I literally cannot proofread any of what I wrote because my computer is crashing everytime I scroll, so oh well hopefully my computer screen starts working again some time tomorrow.
