Welcome to the first post of this blog! Here's what will be posted:

# Projects

Over the next few years, I'm going to be working on a few projects. Most of these will fit into one of two categories:

1. Builds in public, documenting the process from start to finish on this blog. Most of these builds will mostly be large projects, open sourced on Github. The goal of this is to give an insider view on some of the projects I'm working on, and hopefully will increase my motivation when working on long term projects with an end nowhere near in sight. Always feel free to contribute to these projects!

2. Underground projects. I won't mention them until they are finished. If you want to hear about these projects before they're posted here and/or want to collaborate on them, become friends with me.

# Event Updates

Jumping onto the trend and giving this a go. Examples:

- Programs/Camps. Continuing the trend of blogging everyday at long events. If you see me, say hi!
- Contests. If I participate in a contest, I'll write a blog post afterwards here.

I prefer to not say what programs/camps/contests I'm going to.

# Conclusion

Comments are always welcome! Comment on this blog, find me in real life, or message me online.

That's enough for a introduction post. Feel free to share this post with other people, blow up this post with comments, and expect another post soon!
