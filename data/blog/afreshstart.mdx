Welcome to the opening post of this blog! I'm still experimenting with the frequency of posts, but I have a general idea of what I'll post. Here's what you can expect:

# Projects

Over the next year or so, I'm going to be working on a few projects. Most of these will fit into one of two categories:

1. Builds in public, documenting the process from start to finish on this blog. Most of these builds will mostly be large projects, open sourced on Github. The goal of this is to give an insider view on some of the projects I'm working on, and hopefully will increase my motivation when working on long term projects with an end nowhere near in sight. Always feel free to contribute to these projects!

2. Underground projects where I will only write about them after I'm done building them. This will be more of a hit or miss. If you want to collaborate or know what these projects are before everyone else, become friends with me.

# Life Reflections

Life updates seemed to be the most popular part of my old blog, so I'll be continuing this here. I think this is pretty self explanatory - I'll just be explaining and reflecting on what I've been up to for the past month/year.

Over the last school year, a handful of people asked me in the same conversation the same two questions: 1) what do I do in my free time, and 2) why I don't have snapchat or instagram, the standard high school way of letting other people know what you've been doing. Here's the answer: I don't see a purpose for me to get snapchat or instagram because I can keep in touch with the people that I care about by talking to them in real life or messaging them on platforms I already have.

On the other hand, I do realize that a lot of people view me as secretive, mysterious, and unapproachable. I don't really care about the first two, but for the last one I decided that I should try to befriend more people (especially those that don't have similar interests to me), so I should tackle this issue.

Since I don't feel like getting snapchat or instagram, I'm going to do something better - write about my life on this blog! I believe writing gives a more realistic and comprehensive view of my life than a heavily edited photo with a short caption on instagram or a one-liner on snapchat, and I can express myself more accurately here.

# Event Updates

Since this seems popular among other people's blogs, I'll also give this a go. I'm not sure if events is the right word but I couldn't think of a better word, so here are some examples of stuff that fits under this category.

- Programs/Camps. With more Covid-19 restrictions easing, I'm finally going to an in-person summer program! I'll continue the trend that's developed in the past few years of blogging every day at summer camps.
- Contests. If I participate in a contest, I'll write a blog post afterwards here. What I won't do is announce which contests I will take and how I'm preparing for them.

# Contact Information

Comments are always welcome! If you know me in real life, I'm always happy to have a conversation about this blog and basically anything else, whether that conversation be in person or through text (if you don't have my number feel free to ask!). Here are some other places where you can find me online.

- Discord: honeycombi#0294. Note that I often have DMs open only to friends, but feel free to send me a friend request.
- Github: [honeycombi](https://github.com/honeycombi). Please consider giving me a follow, and if I know who you are in real life I'll follow back.
- Linkedin: [honeycombi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/honeycombi/). Feel free to connect with me!
- Email: ghu2024@mka.org. For inquiries related to my nonprofit, shoot me an email at gary@nexusworkshop.org, but do note that I don't check this email too often so response time might be a bit slow.

In terms of response time, the ranking is something along the lines of Discord>Messages>Email>Linkedin, so if you want the fastest response time either DM me on discord or text me. I read messages from text the fastest but I never bothered to set up messages on my computer so replies are generally fairly short; if you want to have a long conversation, discord or calling me is probably more ideal.

If you're wondering why my username is honeycombi, it's because [icosahedral honeycombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedral_honeycomb) are visually pleasing and my favorite pure math subject is [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics).

I think that's enough writing for an introduction post, so I'm going to end the post here. Feel free to share this post with other people, and expect another post fairly soon!
