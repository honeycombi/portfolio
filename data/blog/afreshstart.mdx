Welcome to the opening post of this blog! I'm still experimenting with how often I'm going to post (weekly? biweekly?), but I have a pretty good idea of what I want to post. Here's some things you can expect to be posted on this blog.

# What Will Be Posted?

## Projects in Public

Over the next year or so, I'm going to be working on a few projects and will document the process from start to finish. The goal of this is to give an insider view on some of the projects I'm working on, and hopefully will increase my motivation when working on long term projects with an end nowhere near in sight. Here are some projects that I'm considering doing. Feel free to propose new ideas; contact information is at the end of this post!

- This website. If you haven't noticed yet, this website is very barebones as of now. I'm going to spice things up a bit and try to build a few new features, but no promises on building anything specific because I need to start working on features before I can decide whether they are feasable or not. Some potential ideas for the site that popped up in my head within the last five seconds include a view counter, enabling comments, and a cooler (possibly built using three.js?) homepage.
- Things related to my nonprofit. The project I'm spending most of my time working on now is still underground right now, but after we announce it expect stuff to be posted on this blog. In the meantime, there are plenty of other things I can write about - the website, marketing strategies, planning for the future, etc.
- Speedtyping. Speedtyping is a hobby that I picked up towards the end of last summer, and the thrill of hitting your fingertips rapidly on squares is way more addicting than I expected. As of now, I use the standard qwerty keyboard and practice mainly on [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com). Currently, my records for the 15 seconds and 60 seconds test are 162.29 wpm and 145.18 wpm, respectively. My goal is to someday get up to 200 wpm, but I'm also interested in learning new keyboard layouts. One layout that's particularly interesting to me is the [Colemak Mod-DH layout](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/), which I intend on learning this summer. In the future, I'll use a combination of monkeytype and [typelit](typelit.io/) to increase my wpm.
- Programming. I'm definitely going to pick up a few more languages here and there. Right now, I'm trying to learn [Circom](https://docs.circom.io), a zero knowledge cryptography circuit compiler language. Most programming posts will be about projects, rather than how some language works. In my opinion, blog posts that explain how a programming language works are snooze-inducing because 1) no one actually reads official documentation, so even less people will read badly written copies of documentation written by some random dude who has no idea what he's doing, and 2) there are already only about a Graham's number of blogs that overviewing different programming languages, plus [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) has already effectively formed a monopoly on this niche with his YouTube videos that are infinitely times more engaging than any blog post.
- Math heavy stuff. My interests currently lie mostly with applied zero knowledge cryptography which by default is quite low on theory and I'm not reading any textbooks heavy on math right now, but I might pick a textbook up sometime before the summer ends. I might post some unpolished and unproofread notes up here, but don't expect them to be useful to anyone other than me. Better and more polished stuff will be posted on [The Nexus Workshop's blog](https://www.nexusworkshop.org/blog) instead.

## Life Reflections

Life updates seemed to be the most popular part of my old blog, so I'll be continuing this here. I think this is pretty self explanatory - I'll just be explaining and reflecting on what I've been up to for the past month/year.

Over the last school year, a handful of people asked me in the same conversation the same two questions: 1) what do I do in my free time, and 2) why I don't have snapchat or instagram, the standard high school way of letting other people know what you've been doing. I believe most people ask me the first question because I don't own a snapchat or instagram. To be honest, I don't see a real purpose or need for me to get snapchat or instagram, simply because I believe I can keep in touch with the people that I value well enough without instagram or snapchat, simply by talking to them in real life (I believe real life conversations are much more genuine and meaningful than online conversations) or messaging them on platforms I already have.

On the other hand, I do realize that a lot of people view me as secretive, mysterious, and maybe even unapproachable, because if you aren't a close friend of mine you probably don't know much about me other than the floating rumors. It is true that there are parts of my past (particularly with ice hockey) that I'm not very open to sharing unless I know you very well, but I'd hope that there's still interesting things about me other than my past playing sports. I've decided that maybe I should try being more social and try to befriend more people (especially people that don't come from a similar background and have similar interests to me), so I should tackle this issue. Since I don't feel like getting snapchat or instagram, I'm going to do something better - write about my life on this blog! I believe writing gives a more realistic and comprehensive view of my life than a heavily edited photo with a short caption on instagram or a one-liner on snapchat, and I can express myself more accurately here.

## Event Updates

Since this seems popular among other people's blogs, I'll also give this a go. I'm not sure if events is the right word but I couldn't think of a better word, so here are some examples of stuff that fits under this category.

- Programs/Camps. With more Covid-19 restrictions easing, I finally can go to an in-person summer camp! I'm going to [Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://www.mathcamp.org) this summer (say hi if you see me there!) and potentially another camp later in mid-August, so I'll continue the trend that's developed in the past few years of blogging every day at summer camps.
- Contests. While I passionately participated in math contests in the past a lot and spent probably way too much time preparing for them, I'm not too interested in math contests anymore because 1) it reminds me of stuff that I don't particularly want to think or talk about, and 2) the problems seem finite in a way. If you don't understand what the second point means go read the blogs of others that have said similar things - [Vincent Huang](https://www.vvhuang.com) and [Ali Cy](https://www.ali.cy) (shout out to them they are huge inspirations!) come to my mind instantly. However, I don't want to completely cut ties with competition math, so I'll still participate in contests that my school offers (I am math club captain after all) and blog about them, but I'm not going to prepare as hard as I used to back in 8th grade. Also, I plan on branching out to other contests, including science bowl (I'm a school club leader for this next year, if I know you from school please join!), F=ma (taken this twice but never made USAPhO), and possibly USACO? I'm not particularly fluent in python, java, or C++, so for the last one I would probably need to do a nontrivial amount of prep before I decide to compete.

# Contact Information

Comments are always welcome! If you know me in real life, I'm always happy to have a conversation about this blog and basically anything else, whether that conversation be in person or through text (if you don't have my number feel free to ask!). Here are some other places where you can find me online.

- Discord: honeycombi#0294. Note that I often have DMs open only to friends, but feel free to send me a friend request.
- Github: [honeycombi](https://github.com/honeycombi). Please consider giving me a follow, and if I know who you are in real life I'll follow back.
- Linkedin: [honeycombi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/honeycombi/). Feel free to connect with me!
- Email: ghu2024@mka.org. For inquiries related to my nonprofit, shoot me an email at gary@nexusworkshop.org, but do note that I don't check this email too often so response time might be a bit slow.

In terms of response time, the ranking is something along the lines of Discord>Messages>Email>Linkedin, so if you want the fastest response time either DM me on discord or text me. I read messages from text the fastest but I never bothered to set up messages on my computer so replies are generally fairly short; if you want to have a long conversation, discord or calling me is probably more ideal.

If you're wondering why my username is honeycombi, it's because [icosahedral honeycombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedral_honeycomb) are visually pleasing and my favorite pure math subject is [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics).

I think that's enough writing for an introduction post, so I'm going to end the post here. Feel free to share this post with other people, and expect another post fairly soon!
