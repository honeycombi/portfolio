I woke up around 6am and went to breakfast at 7am. Breakfast was mostly empty, and afterwards I went to the gym to do my standard pull routine. The gym is really big and nice!

Onto classes

- Computability theory. I felt the class was easy to understand, but the homework is really hard. This is my only HR class, but the homework is probably the hardest among all of my classes. At least the lecturer presents stuff really well!
- Complexity theory. I didn't have to move to a different room for this class so it was nice. I have briefly seen stuff in this class so the content wasn't too hard to follow, but I did get really confused at the end because I don't understand how to prove that NP is a subset of PSPACE or how PSPACE is a subset of EXPTIME, both of which are hw problems.
- Linear algebra. This class was super slow and easy, so I'm going to go Overly Convoluted Plans tomorrow.
- Jacobi sums. This class was super interesting, probably my favorite so far. This is also a 4-chili course so it's kind of hard but I think I'll do fine.

Overall, classes are quite hard but I think I can manage them.

Other stuff:

- Lunch was super crowded and the line was out the cafeteria.
- Po's colloqium on Applied Game Theory included very little math but still managed to be pretty interesting!
- I struggled on HW problems for the entirety of TAU.
- I fakesolved like every homework problem I attempted so I got annoyed and decided to go on a walk alone through the middle of campus at 8PM, it was very relaxing and fun.

I'm nowhere near being done with HW but I'm tired so I'm going to go to bed soon and then wake up early again.
